# intro-climate-data-analysis
A very basic introduction to loading and plotting data from Earth System Climate models.

Climate data analysis tutorial
An Introduction: Plotting your first temperature map

This tutorial is an elementary introduction to getting started with hands-on data analysis of climate models from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6).

Intended users: Students with no prior experience in climate data analysis, and intoductory programming background.

## Learning objectives:
<ul> 
<li> Read CMIP data (netcdf) files </li>
<li> Understand the structure of data (spatial and temporal) </li>
<li> Plotting absolute temperature for one model (with respect to a given baseline)  </li>
<li> Calculate and plot temperature change (anomaly) </li>
<li> Additional tasks: Plot a multi-model map for a given period </li>
<li> Further ideas for exploratory data analysis </li>
</ul>
