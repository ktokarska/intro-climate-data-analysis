# intro-climate-data-analysis
A very basic introduction to loading and plotting data from Earth System Climate models.

Climate data analysis tutorial
An Introduction: Plotting your first temperature map

This tutorial is an elementary introduction to getting started with hands-on data analysis of climate models from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6).

Intended users: Students with no prior experience in climate data analysis, and intoductory programming background.

# Learning objectives:

    Read CMIP data (netcdf) files
    Understand the structure of data (spatial and temporal)
    Plotting absolute temperature for one model (with respect to a given baseline)
    Calculate and plot temperature change (anomaly)
    Additional tasks: Plot a multi-model map for a given period
    Further ideas for exploratory data analysis
