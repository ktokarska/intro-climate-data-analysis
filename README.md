# intro-climate-data-analysis

This tutorial is a very basic introduction to getting started with hands-on data analysis of climate models from Earth System Climate models (usch as the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP6).

_Intended users: Students with no prior experience in climate data analysis, and intoductory programming background._

## Learning objectives:
<ul> 
<li> Read CMIP climate model  data (netcdf) files </li>
<li> Understand the structure of data (spatial and temporal) </li>
<li> Plotting absolute temperature for one model (with respect to a given baseline)  </li>
<li> Calculate and plot temperature change (anomaly) </li>
<li> Additional tasks: Plot a multi-model map for a given period </li>
<li> Further ideas for exploratory data analysis </li>
</ul>
